        <p><b>Apple is my favourite because it is a delicious and nutritious fruit.</b> <br>It comes in different sizes, varieties and colours.<br> The red and yellow apple is the most popular type.<br> My favourite one is the green apple because it is tangy and flavourful.<br> One of the characteristic features of apples is that they are one of the most abundant fruit trees<br> in the cold climate; hence, they are available throughout the year.<br> Apples are highly nutritious and contain different types of vitamins and minerals.<br></p>

        <p>If I had to choose just one hobby from all the ones I enjoy, it would be gardening.<br> But I also have a passion for dancing, which I discovered at a young age.<br> My parents were amazed by how naturally I moved to the music.<br> Dancing is not only fun but also affordable.<br>

         I've always loved music and dance, yet I never fully understood their profound joy.<br> Dancing provides excellent exercise, teaching us to move to the rhythm and feel the musicâ€™s pulse.<br> This physical activity is incredibly enjoyable.</p>
